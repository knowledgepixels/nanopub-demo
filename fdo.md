# Nanopubs for FDOs: Demo

---

This demo gives you a quick hands-on demo into the work-in-progress solution of using [nanopublications](https://nanopub.net) to implement [FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs)](https://fairdo.org/).

You might also want to check out [this general demo about nanopublications](index.html).

## 1. Login to Nanodash

To try out the steps below on your own, you'll need to login to the [Nanodash](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/) interface with your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) account.

[Register](https://orcid.org/register) to get such an ORCID account for free, if you don't have one already.


## 2. Defining FDOs with nanopublications via Nanodash

Publish one or more nanopublications from these templates:

- [Defining an FDO](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?template=https://w3id.org/np/RAei7xbeufZtrwog4_xImDCX5wrSZspYKZeUIx_EComBw&template-version=latest)
- [Defining a new class (FDO types could be defined similarly in the future)](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?template=https://w3id.org/np/RAxfD9wQMHU4DmWta5uRpo723ZgKpizglley4gtcxG0hg&template-version=latest)

You can find more templates [here](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish).


## 3. Check out published nanopublications

All nanopublications are published to a [decentralized network of services](https://monitor.knowledgepixels.com/).

We can access this knowledge with queries like these:

- [See all FDOs defined in nanopublications](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/resulttable?query=RAZgtM7Kzb0aTBlH4coOzlfgzBOoofqROCIMZTW3KliLQ/get-fdos)


## 4. Introduce yourself and be approved by community

To properly introduce yourself, you can publish an introduction via your [Nanodash profile page](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/profile).

Somebody on the list of [approved users](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/userlist) can now approve your introduction.
