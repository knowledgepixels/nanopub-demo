This demo gives you a quick hands-on introduction into [nanopublications](https://nanopub.net) via the [Nanodash](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com) interface.

Just follow the four steps below.

--- 

## 1. Establish your identity with ORCID

You will need an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) account for this hands-on demo.

[Register](https://orcid.org/register), if you don't have one already.


## 2. Publish a piece of open data with Nanodash

Publish one or more nanopublications from these templates:

- [Stating that something is over-/underrated](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?template=http://purl.org/np/RA6p8TsYKPUmy6yoKuxjBKn2vRKczjIWrcS2lyyX61myE&template-version=latest)
- [Linking an organism to an environment](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?template=http://purl.org/np/RAMwUIw3VZ2ghf1HS6lOhuIs-vp0GAXbw8YtmQfni2ea8&template-version=latest)
- [Publishing a plain-text message](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish?template=https://w3id.org/np/RA66vcP_zCtPYIqFaQkv-WhjYZnUiToHRG5EmbMAovZSw&template-version=latest)

You can find more templates [here](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/publish).


## 3. Check out published nanopublications

All nanopublications are published to a [decentralized network of services](https://monitor.knowledgepixels.com/).

We can access this knowledge with queries like these:

- [All over-/underrated opinions](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/resulttable?query=RAcQSC_S5n3SNE-hhKuRFah5MG9d1OZtl4765rm35k19Q/get-overunderrated-entries)
- [Top overrated things](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/resulttable?query=RAZuzkHF692vje-H5_6SU7FFktEFDG5xhAgWoRo1FxcBY/get-top-overrated)
- [Top underrated things](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/resulttable?query=RAcdE_TAqkHUH2RpE6s4q9Fs7vg_CBaeQF6OVdaM1ZCvw/get-top-underrated)
- [Latest nanopublications (without example nanopublications)](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/resulttable?query=RAAq7D8hWYXL-XTflG1u19maDe7nSJy6Iun5wa_KadOqg/get-latest-nanopubs)
- [Latest example nanopublications](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/resulttable?query=RAlmS9Sp0Cjxv6vyiJff6TWWqNfJXj7LmkdoLNy6ZSeJ8/get-latest-example-nanopubs)


## 4. Introduce yourself and be approved by community

To properly introduce yourself, you can publish an introduction via your [Nanodash profile page](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/profile).

Somebody on the list of [approved users](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/userlist) can now approve your introduction.
